# Known issues  
This plugin currently over-rides the Core post.hbs file.  
This is _NOT_ best practice as the plugin's post.hbs needs to be maintained to reflect any changes made in the Core post.hbs file.       
Links need to be right-click open-in-new to work else results in the No Permission page.

I'm still learning so you are most likely a better coder than I am, but I frequently visit these forums and either I or others should be able to help.
